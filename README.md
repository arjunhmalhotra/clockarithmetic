# clockarithmetic
This simple program computes clock arithmetic as a function of two user formatted input prompts. The program splits up the entered time stamps and separates the hour, minute, and second inputs respectively from both user inputs. A range on the timestamps is a redundant restriction in the algorithm due to the nature of the input -- owing to the fact that no clock displays seconds and minutes higher than an increment of 60 and hours in that of 24. The program accounts for the 'overflow' of seconds into minutes, minutes into hours, and hours into the time on the next day.
